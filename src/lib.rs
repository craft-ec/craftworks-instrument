//! Permanent instrumentation: a frozen four-event spine, a trait that can never
//! become an input, a recorder that drops rather than grows, and a dump that
//! prints itself when a test fails.
//!
//! # Why it is shaped like this
//!
//! Every constraint here was bought by a failure.
//!
//! - **`Edge` pairs a request with its response by id**, so *outstanding* is a
//!   subtraction rather than a consumer-side guess. Four harness runs were
//!   voided in one day for want of that number: a reader that had sent
//!   thousands of requests nobody would ever answer looked exactly like a
//!   reader doing its job.
//! - **`fn event(&self, e: Event)` returns unit and the trait has no read-back
//!   method.** Instrumented code therefore cannot branch on the probe, so the
//!   probe cannot become an input. That is the failure mode that turns a
//!   measurement into a story about itself.
//! - **A full ring DROPS and counts the drop.** It never grows (an unbounded
//!   buffer is a leak in a long run) and never panics (a probe that fails a
//!   passing test is the worst kind of behaviour change).
//! - **A per-recorder SEQUENCE, never a clock.** A delegate has no clock (F32),
//!   and a wall-clock stamp is a correlation handle across recordings.
//! - **No user content by VOCABULARY** — see [`vocab`]. Not "the payload is
//!   small": every key and enumerated value comes from a reviewed list, because
//!   the probes ship in production as the support tool.
