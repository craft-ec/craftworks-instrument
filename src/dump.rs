//! The failure dump: the consumer this vocabulary was designed for.
//!
//! The rule this crate exists to serve is "a test that fails must already have
//! recorded WHY" — running bare, failing, then re-running with one-off debug
//! added was the most repeated waste in the project, and the one-off probes
//! were thrown away each time.
//!
//! So the dump has ONE requirement, and the vocabulary was chosen to meet it:
//! **a human reading the last N events must be able to tell a wedge from
//! work.** That is why `Edge` pairs by id — the wedge that voided four harness
//! runs was "thousands of requests sent, none answered", and nothing but
//! OUTSTANDING says that.
