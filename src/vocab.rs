//! The vocabulary: every word an event may contain.
//!
//! **Redaction is by VOCABULARY, not by type.** A fixed-size, `Copy`, strongly
//! typed value can still be sensitive — `domain = "medical"` is all three. So
//! the guarantee this crate offers is not "the payload is small" but "every key
//! and every enumerated value came from this file, which is reviewed".
//!
//! A site therefore cannot emit a value DERIVED from user data, however small.
//! The three shapes that would otherwise leak are each given a lawful form:
//!
//! - **Foreign ids** are LABELLED per bundle (`peer#3`), never truncated. A
//!   truncated id drawn from an enumerable population is not anonymous — a
//!   few thousand candidates are trivially re-identified — so truncation is
//!   not offered at all. The label→id table lives with whoever recorded it and
//!   is never part of a bundle.
//! - **Sizes of sealed data** are reported as a PADDED CLASS, because the exact
//!   length of a ciphertext is a property of the plaintext.
//! - **Counts derived from user data** are BUCKETED, and times are COARSENED
//!   offsets from the start of the recording.
//!
//! **The bar RISES rather than falls.** ARCHITECTURE §5 now sends execution
//! facts to an adjacent REPLICATED tree, so "never leaves the device unasked"
//! becomes "published by construction" — a recording that was merely private
//! before is shared by default, and every guarantee above has to hold against
//! that.
//!
//! The guard is the `&'static str` lifetime, which a runtime value cannot have:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! # use instrument::vocab::Site;
//! let from_user: String = std::env::args().next().unwrap();
//! let site = Site::of(&from_user); // does not live long enough
//! ```
//!
//! `Box::leak` would defeat it. That is the honest limit: the lifetime stops
//! the accident, not someone determined to leak.

/// Where an event happened.
///
/// A newtype so it cannot be built from a runtime string: the only way to make
/// one is [`Site::of`], which takes a `&'static str` — a compile-time literal

/// # The third class: WOULD-PAY-OR-STEER

/// The sort is three ways, not two. Anything that can **pay or steer a

/// at all, and may never be emitted as one.
///
/// ARCHITECTURE §5 settles why: *"if node behaviour steers keeper selection,
/// 'B says A answered in T' counts and 'A says A is fast' does not — the
/// subject never attests to itself."* Such a fact is a **receipt the
/// COUNTERPARTY signs into its own tree**, double-entry, and a balance moves
/// only where both halves agree (§14). A self-reported number cannot be any of
/// that: it has one author, who profits from it.
///
/// So this crate's keys are for **diagnosis only**. §5 again: *"Observations
/// that only DIAGNOSE need no receipt, because nobody profits from a wrong
/// latency figure that steers nothing; the two classes are separated from the
/// first event, not later."*
///

/// nobody thought of one — it is empty because a key that belongs there does
/// not belong in this crate. The list exists so that the first quota counter
/// has somewhere to be declared, and declaring it fails a test with the
